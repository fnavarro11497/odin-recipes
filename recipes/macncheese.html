      <h2 class="desc">What & How:</h2>
      <p>
        No matter how much culinary training I've gone through, and no matter
        how many high-end ingredients I cook with or fancy restaurants I eat at,
        few things in the world can compete with the sheer deliciousness and
        childish pleasure of stove-top mac and cheese. Who doesn't love gooey,
        cheesy, creamy, salty pasta, even when (or especially when?) it comes
        out of that blue box? For me—and I presume for many of you—it's a
        built-in taste memory, and a powerful one at that.
      </p>
      <h3 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 pound elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>One 12-ounce can evaporated milk</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Frank’s RedHot or other hot sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground mustard</li>
        <li>1 pound extra-sharp cheddar, grated</li>
        <li>8 ounces American cheese, cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into 4 chunks</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="steps">Steps:</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Place the macaroni in a large saucepan and cover it with salted water
          by 2 inches.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally to keep the
          pasta from sticking.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cover the pan, remove from the heat, and let stand until the pasta is
          barely al dente, about 8 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, whisk together the evaporated milk, eggs, hot sauce, and
          mustard in a bowl until homogeneous. Toss the cheeses with the
          cornstarch in a large bowl until thoroughly combined.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the pasta is cooked, drain it and return it to the saucepan.
        </li>
        <li>Place over low heat, add the butter, and stir until melted.</li>
        <li>Evenly spread 1/3 of cheese over sauce.</li>
        <li>
          Add the milk mixture and cheese mixture and cook, stirring constantly,
          until the cheese is completely melted and the mixture is hot and
          creamy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Season to taste with salt and more hot sauce. Serve immediately,
          topping with toasted bread crumbs if desired.
        </li>
      </ol>
