    <h2 class="desc">What & How:</h2>
    <p>
      New York pizza is my favorite style of pizza. Sure, I love me a
      neo-Neapolitan, sit-down-with-a-fork-and-knife pizza on occasion, and
      grilled pizzas are fantastic in the summer. Even chewy, Roman-style pizza
      bianca has its place. But the pizza I find myself most often craving is of
      the simple, by-the-slice, medium-thin, crusty, and lightly chewy style.

    <h3 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        22 1/2 ounces bread flour, plus more for dusting (638g; about 4 1/2
        cups)
      </li>
      <li>0.5 ounce granulated sugar (15g; about 1 1/2 tablespoons)</li>
      <li>0.35 ounce kosher salt (10g; about 1 tablespoon)</li>
      <li>0.35 ounce instant yeast (10g; about 2 teaspoons)</li>
      <li>15 ounces lukewarm water (415g; about 1 3/4 cups)(see note)</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons (45ml) extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1 batch New York Style Pizza Sauce</li>
      <li>
        1 pound grated full-fat dry mozzarella cheese (454g; about 4 cups),
        placed in freezer for at least 15 minutes
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="steps">Steps:</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Combine flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in bowl of food processor</li>
      <li>
        Transfer dough ball to lightly floured surface and knead once or twice
        by hand until smooth ball is formed.
      </li>
      <li>
        At least two hours before baking, remove dough from refrigerator and
        shape into balls by gathering dough towards bottom and pinching shut.
      </li>
      <li>
        One hour before baking, adjust oven rack with pizza stone to middle
        position and preheat oven to 500°F (260°C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread approximately 2/3 cup sauce evenly over surface of crust, leaving
        1/2- to 1-inch border along edge.
      </li>
      <li>Evenly spread 1/3 of cheese over sauce.</li>
      <li>
        Slide pizza onto baking stone and bake until cheese is melted with some
        browned spots and crust is golden brown and puffed, 12 to 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Transfer to cutting board, slice, and serve immediately.</li>
      <li>
        Repeat with remaining two dough balls, remaining sauce, and remaining
        cheese.
      </li>
    </ol>
